  Mission to Mars

  # Overview
  
  <p>For this project we were tasked with using Splinter, BeautifulSoup, MongoDB, and Flask to scrape various websites about the planet Mars and create a website to display that information</p>
  
  ## Results
<p>The script successfully scrapes the following websites and displays it on a Flask webpage. The page was then further stylized with additional color using Bootstrap</p>

* https://redplanetscience.com/
* https://spaceimages-mars.com
* https://galaxyfacts-mars.com
* https://marshemispheres.com/

## Example
  <p>This is what the website looks like at the time of uploading (at 50% to show the whole page) </p>
